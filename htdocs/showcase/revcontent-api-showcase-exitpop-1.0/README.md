# Exit Pop

Exit Pop is an API implementation that pops up on a user's first impression every 24 hours for non-touch enabled devices (e.g. desktops). When the user mouses off the page they are usually trying to close the window or navigate away from the page. Exit Pop is a great way to give these users one more chance to view your Revcontent API widget.
