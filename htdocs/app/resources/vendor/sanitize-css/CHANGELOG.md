## 1.0.0 (2012-11-06)

- Updated: Moved from normalize.css to sanitize.css

> Normalize.css had and still has opinionated, developer-centric styles. For example, `sub` and `sup` elements are styled to not impact the line height of text, and `table`, `th`, and `td` omit all spacing. As Nicolas pushed Normalize.css into maturity, future preferences like these no longer had a place in the project. Almost a year later, Sanitize was officially branded. Where Normalize.css conservatively follows user agent consensus and results in more pre-styled elements, Sanitize.css liberally follows developer consensus and results in more unstyled elements.

## 0.0.0 (2011-04-21)

- Added: Normalize.css
